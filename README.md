# Prediction_Project_Data_Analytic

**Bank Churn Prediction Project**

**Project Description**
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a bank using a classification model. The dataset used is publicly available from the YBI Foundation, containing customer details and their churn status. The project involves various stages such as data analysis, data preprocessing, handling class imbalance, and building a machine learning model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with hyperparameter tuning.

The project aims to identify key factors contributing to customer churn and improve prediction accuracy by addressing class imbalance through Random Under Sampling (RUS) and Random Over Sampling (ROS) techniques. The final models are evaluated based on their performance metrics to determine the best approach.

**Key Steps and Methodologies**
1. Data Analysis and Preprocessing
Imported necessary libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Loaded the dataset from a public URL
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using df.head(), df.info(), and value_counts()
Removed duplicate values and set CustomerId as the index
Applied encoding on categorical columns like Geography and Gender
Created a new feature Zero Balance to indicate customers with zero balance
2. Handling Class Imbalance
Visualized the class imbalance in the Churn target column
Applied two sampling techniques to handle imbalance:
Random Under Sampling (RUS)
Random Over Sampling (ROS)
3. Data Splitting and Standardization
Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split
Standardized continuous features such as CreditScore, Age, Tenure, Balance, and Estimated Salary using StandardScaler
4. Model Building: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Built an SVM model using the SVC class from sklearn
Evaluated the initial model performance using confusion_matrix and classification_report
Improved the model using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
Tuned parameters such as C, gamma, kernel, and class_weight
Built and evaluated models with:
Original Data
Random Under Sampled Data
Random Over Sampled Data
5. Model Evaluation and Comparison
Compared model performances using:
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
Compared the following models:
SVM with Original Data
SVM with Random Under Sampling
SVM with Random Over Sampling
Key Libraries Used
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Imbalanced-learn (for RUS and ROS)
Project Outcome
The project successfully built and evaluated various SVM models to predict customer churn. The hyperparameter-tuned models using Random Over Sampling (ROS) showed the best performance, reducing class imbalance and improving prediction accuracy.
